    Returns
    --------------
    bool
        Returns True if the value can be converted to a float, indicating that it is safe for numerical calculations.
        Returns False if the value cannot be converted to a float or if the value is None (e.g., for empty cells).

    (1) A correction has been made during data post processing (QA/QC checks) to fix an error.
    (2) A value has been confirmed as correctly transcribed.
    (3) A value has been identified as wrongly transcribed.

    Parameters
    --------------
